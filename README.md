# AOS-1

### GENERAL INFO

AOS is an open-source OS created and produced by Nanobot567. It is made in Python 3.7 and coded in Visual Studio Code.

### RUNNING AOS

Download AOS to your desktop. Then, run it in [Python's IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or a compatible Python executer. 

Some computers already have python installed, but not IDLE. To check this, type this into your command line:

#### Mac

```
    $ python -V
```

#### Windows

```
    > python --version
```

#### Linux

```
    > python
```

An easier way to run it would be through a repl such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Just copy-paste the code into the box on the left.

### FINAL WORDS

Thank you so much for using AOS! AOS-2 is available [here](https://github.com/Nanobot567/AOS-2/).
